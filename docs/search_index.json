[["index.html", "Guide to Using Census Data 1 Census Data", " Guide to Using Census Data Ryan Brenner Updated: Tuesday, February 24, 2026 at 07:36 PM 1 Census Data Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the US Constitution requires that the actual Enumeration [for apportioning Representatives] shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The first meeting of the Congress of the United States took place in 1789, the first enumeration was conducted in 1790, and a count has been taken every subsequent term of ten years as the Decennial Census ever since. U.S. marshals initially tabulated Census data, then trained enumerators took over in 1880 with in-person interviews, and finally households began completing their own questionnaires in 1960 when the Census began distributing forms by mail. The Census was first administered under the Secretary of State, then moved to the Department of the Interior in 1849, and finally shifted in 1902 to a newly established permanent Census Office within the Department of Commerce and Labor, the predecessor of todays Department of Commerce and the modern U.S. Census Bureau. Over time, the Census has expanded from a simple headcount with only six questions related to age, sex, and race into a broad statistical system that now includes more than 200 separate surveys. The scope of the Decennial Census gradually expanded throughout the 1800s to include manufacturing, agriculture (including slavery), and natural resource extraction. The 1890 Decennial Census was the first to join administrative data to supplement enumeration records, opening the Census to broader demographic and statistical uses beyond the constitutional requirement. In the 1940s, statistical sampling was first used to send a long form questionnaire to a subset of households, bifurcating the Decennial Census into a true census for enumeration and a survey estimate for all other information. In 2010, the long form was removed from the Decennial Census and became the American Community Survey, a detailed survey sent to a sample of households annually. The Congressional Research Service divides the Census Bureaus contemporary work into two accounts: (1) Periodic Censuses and Programs and (2) Current Surveys and Programs. The Periodic Censuses and Programs include some of the most well-known Census products: Decennial Census of Population and Housing: the constitutionally required, full enumeration that produces the population count used for apportionment, redistricting, and baseline demographic figures. American Community Survey (ACS): the continuous, sample-based survey that replaced the decennial long form, providing detailed characteristics on social, economic, housing, and demographic conditions. Economic Census: a comprehensive count of U.S. business activity conducted every five years, producing structural information about industries, employment, sales, and the economic composition of the country. Census of Governments: a comprehensive inventory conducted every five years of federal, state, and local governments, including their employment, finances, structures, and activities. The Current Surveys and Programs include the continuous, between-census data collections and tabulations that produce the nations primary demographic and economic indicators: Population Estimates Program (PEP): annual official estimates of population totals (i.e., adjustments from the Decennial Census), used in funding formulas, planning, and demographic analysis. Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP): a major panel survey that tracks income, program eligibility, benefit dynamics, and economic well-being over time. Current Population Survey (CPS): a monthly labor-force survey (conducted jointly with BLS) producing the official source for unemployment rates, labor-force participation, and related labor statistics. The remainder of this guide walks through basic usage of Census data.

As a result, selecting a survey product and variables also requires choosing the geographic level at which those variables will be aggregated. Smaller geographic units generally have higher margins of error, and some variables are unavailable at the smallest scales. Analyses that rely on these small units often use ACS 5-year estimates to pool five years of responses and improve accuracy. Beyond data availability, the appropriate geographic level depends on the projects unit of analysis and overall analytical design. While Census blocks and tracts form the building blocks of all geographic levels at which Census data is reported, not all geographic levels perfectly nest. Nested geographies refers to the hierarchical spine from Census block to nation, where each unit at a lower level is fully contained within a single unit at the next level up, and each higher-level unit is completely partitioned into lower-level units. Non-nesting geographies still rely on Census blocks and tracts, but their boundaries sometimes cross those of higher levels (e.g., metropolitan statistical areas cross state lines, places like New York City cross county lines). Although Census blocks, tracts, and certain geographies such as congressional districts are collaboratively delineated so that Census data can be accurately aggregated to those geographies, many other geographies are defined independently (e.g., ZIP Codes). Because these independently defined units cannot be directly aggregated from Census blocks and tracks, the Census Bureau produces tabulation areas (e.g., ZCTAs) that approximate non-Census geographies using Census blocks and tracts. As a specific tabulation area becomes more widely used, the Census Bureau sometimes works with the managers of the approximated geography to better reflect the geography with Census blocks and tracts (e.g., the Census Bureau working with NYC DCP to redraw block and tract boundaries to better reflect Community Districts). 2.1 Background The U.S. is composed of states and territories whose borders were fixed at the time of their admission to the union. With few exceptions, every state and territory is fully subdivided into counties or county-equivalent jurisdictions (e.g., parishes in Louisiana, boroughs in Alaska, municipios in Puerto Rico). States and territories all contain various forms of local government (e.g., cities, towns, and villages), though some states have counties entirely partitioned into local governments (e.g., towns in New York) while others maintain extensive unincorporated areas with no municipal government below the county level (e.g., unincorporated Los Angeles County). Historically, the Census has always reported data for these higher-level geographies. Aside from larger cities with legally defined wards, Census data was not reported for smaller geographies until the end of the nineteenth century. For the 1890 Census, the federal government worked with several cities to establish sanitary districts, a new sub-ward level designed to provide more granular data for geographies with no independent legal status. These became the first small-area geographies ever reported by the Census, but the approach was abandoned in 1900. Meanwhile, settlement house researchers and other Progressive Era reformers were producing their own statistical neighborhoods and pressing the Census Bureau to adopt a consistent neighborhood-level reporting system. In the early 1900s, Dr. Walter Laidlaw attempted to use New York State Assembly Districts to study neighborhood conditions in NYC. When the state redrew its district boundaries in 1905, he concluded that assembly districts were too unstable for long-term demographic analysis. Thus, in 1906 he published a paper proposing a system of permanent small areas with boundaries that would remain consistent between Censuses. He then persuaded the newly created Census Bureau to pilot the idea in the 1910 Census, producing tract tabulations for NYC as well as Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis. The group expanded for the 1930 Census to include Los Angeles, Columbus, Nashville, Berkeley, Syracuse, and Yonkers. In 1931, the American Statistical Association formed a Committee on Census Enumeration Areas and appointed Howard Whipple Green as chair; Mr. Green spent the next twenty-five years encouraging cities nationwide to adopt and use the new tracts. Institutionally, the Census Bureau standardized the tract delineation process in 1934. For the 1940 Census, it also began reporting block-level data for all cities with at least 50,000 residents. In cities where Census tracts already existed, blocks were nested within them; in cities without tracts, the Bureau created block areas (renamed block numbering areas (BNAs) in 1960) to function as equivalent geographies to tracts. During the 1970s and 1980s, BNAs expanded across much of the country, with the 1990 Census being the first to assign every part of the US to both a Census block and a tract/BNA. The 2000 Census then retired the BNA system entirely and converted all BNAs into Census tracts. 2.2 Nested Geographies Taking full advantage of the nesting of these geographies, the Census Bureau labels units in each level with GEOIDs that build upon the GEOIDs of higher levels of geography so the full code string contains information: Level GEOID Structure Digits Example Area Example GEOID State STATE 2 New York 36 County STATE+COUNTY 2+3=5 New York, NY (Manhattan) 36081 Census Tract STATE+COUNTY+TRACT 2+3+6=11 Census Tract 65 in New York, NY 36081006500 Census Block Group STATE+COUNTY+TRACT+FIRST DIGIT OF BLOCK 2+3+6+1=12 Block Group 1 in Census Tract 65 in New York, NY 360810065001 Census Block STATE+COUNTY+TRACT+BLOCK 2+3+6+4=15 Block 1006 in Census Tract 65 in New York, NY 360810065001006 A note of caution: Notice how Census Tract 65 became 006500 in the GEOID. When split out in a separate column and named, tracts will often have whole numbers like 65 and decimals like 206.01 (as a new tract was split from prior tract 206). When reconstructing the GEOID from the component FIPS codes, check the tract names and multiply all values by 100 if there are decimals. data %&gt;% dplyr::mutate( GEOID = stringr::str_c( stringr::str_pad(state_fips, width = 2, side = &quot;left&quot;, pad = &quot;0&quot;), stringr::str_pad(county_fips, width = 3, side = &quot;left&quot;, pad = &quot;0&quot;), stringr::str_pad(round(tract_number * 100), width = 6, side = &quot;left&quot;, pad = &quot;0&quot;), stringr::str_pad(block_number, width = 4, side = &quot;left&quot;, pad = &quot;0&quot;) ) ) 2.2.1 Nation tidycensus term = us Nation is the broadest geographic unit used for the presentation of Census data, representing the United States as a single summary entity. It encompasses the fifty states and the District of Columbia, though U.S. Territories, including Puerto Rico, are not part of the Nation for most Census data products. 2.2.2 Regions tidycensus term = region Census Regions are groupings of states and the District of Columbia that subdivide the United States for the presentation of census data. There are four census regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Each of the four census regions is divided into two or more census divisions. Each census region is identified by a single-digit census code. The U.S. Territories, including Puerto Rico, are not part of any census region or census division. 2.2.3 Divisions tidycensus term = division Census Divisions are groupings of states and the District of Columbia that are subdivisions of the four census regions. There are nine census divisions, and each is identified by a single-digit census code. The U.S. Territories, including Puerto Rico, are not part of any census region or census division. 2.2.4 States tidycensus term = state NY = 36 All States + DC = c(1:2, 4:6, 8:13, 15:42, 44:51, 53:56) States and Equivalent Entities are the primary governmental divisions of the United States. In addition to the 50 states, the Census Bureau treats the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as the statistical equivalents of states for the purpose of data presentation. 2.2.5 Counties tidycensus term = county NYC = c(\"005\", \"047\", \"061\", \"081\", \"085\") The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and census areas; the latter of which are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. Additionally, the Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: municipios in Puerto Rico, districts and islands in American Samoa, municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and, thus, constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation in decennial censuses. All of the counties in Connecticut and Rhode Island and nine counties in Massachusetts were dissolved as functioning governmental entities; however, the Census Bureau continues to present data for these historical entities in order to provide comparable geographic units at the county level of the geographic hierarchy for these states and represents them as nonfunctioning legal entities in data products. Each county or statistically equivalent entity is assigned a three-character numeric Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code based on alphabetical sequence that is unique within state, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code. 2.2.6 Tracts tidycensus term = tract (must include a state or list of states) Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity that can be updated by local participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureaus Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant responded or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow nonvisible legal boundaries, such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations, to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. Tribal census tracts are a unique geographic entity defined within federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands and can cross state and county boundaries. The tribal census tracts may be completely different from the standard county-based census tracts defined for the same area. 2.2.7 Block Groups tidycensus term = block group (must include a state or list of states) Block Groups (BGs) are statistical divisions of census tracts, are generally defined to contain between 600 and 3,000 people, and are used to present data and control block numbering. A block group consists of clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their four-digit census block number. For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003, . . . , 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 3 in that census tract. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureaus Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate in PSAP, and a regional organization or the State Data Center was not available to participate. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within the census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross state, county, or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of any other geographic entity. Tribal census tracts and tribal BGs are separate and unique geographic areas defined within federally recognized American Indian reservations and can cross state and county boundaries. The tribal census tracts and tribal block groups may be completely different from the standard county-based census tracts and block groups defined for the same area. 2.2.8 Blocks tidycensus term = block (must include a state or list of states) Blocks (Census Blocks or Tabulation Blocks) are statistical areas bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by nonvisible boundaries, such as selected property lines and city, township, school district, and county limits and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Generally, blocks are small in area; for example, a city block bounded on all sides by streets. Blocks in suburban and rural areas may be larger, more irregular in shape, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and transmission lines. In remote areas, blocks may even encompass hundreds of square miles. Blocks cover the entire territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Blocks nest within all other tabulated census geographic entities at the time of the decennial census and are the basis for all tabulated data from that census. Blocks are numbered uniquely with a four-digit census block number from 0000 to 9999 within census tract, which nest within state and county. The first digit of the census block number identifies the block group. Block numbers beginning with a zero (in Block Group 0) are intended to include only water area, but not all water-only blocks have block numbers beginning with 0 (zero). 2.3 Non-Nesting Geographies 2.3.1 Place tidycensus term = place (must include a state or list of states) NYC = 3651000 Incorporated Places are those reported to the Census Bureau as legally in existence as of January 1, as reported in the latest Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS), under the laws of their respective states. An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always are within a single state or equivalent entity, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. For Census Bureau data tabulation and presentation purposes, incorporated places exclude: Boroughs in Alaska (treated as statistical equivalents of counties); Towns in the New England states, New York, and Wisconsin (treated as MCDs); Boroughs in New York (treated as MCDs). Census Designated Places (CDPs) are the statistical counterparts of incorporated places, and are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials and generally updated prior to each decennial census. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. CDPs must be contained within a single state and may not extend into an incorporated place. There are no population size requirements for CDPs, but they must include some residential population or housing. Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam are the only states or state-equivalent entities that have no incorporated places recognized by the Census Bureau. All places shown in decennial census data products for Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam are CDPs. By agreement with the State of Hawaii, the Census Bureau does not show data separately for the city of Honolulu, which is coextensive with Honolulu County. In Puerto Rico, CDPs are described as comunidades or zonas urbanas. Hamlets, primarily in the State of New York, are usually represented as CDPs in Census Bureau products. Place Codes are of two types. The five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) place code is assigned based on alphabetical sequence within a state. If place names are duplicated within a state and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by the primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, they are assigned alphabetically by their legal descriptions (for example, city before village). Places also are assigned an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code. 2.3.2 Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) tidycensus term = cbsa New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metro Area = 35620 Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) consist of the county or counties or equivalent entities associated with at least one core (Census Bureau-defined Urban Area) of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties associated with the core. The general concept of a CBSA is that of a core area containing a substantial population nucleus, together with adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration with that core. The term core based statistical area refers collectively to metropolitan statistical areas and micropolitan statistical areas. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines CBSAs to provide a nationally consistent, standard set of geographic entities for the United States and Puerto Rico for use in tabulating and presenting statistical data. Statistical areas related to CBSAs include metropolitan divisions, combined statistical areas (CSAs), New England city and town areas (NECTAs), NECTA divisions, and combined NECTAs. 2.3.3 Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) tidycensus term = puma Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are statistical geographic areas for the dissemination of decennial census and American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample files in which the Census Bureau provides selected extracts of raw data from a small sample of census records that are screened to protect confidentiality. The ACS also uses the PUMAs as a tabulation geographic entity. In NYC, PUMAs are an approximation of Community Districts, although the Census Bureau worked with NYC DCP to create new Community District Tabulation Areas (CDTAs): 2.3.4 ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) tidycensus term = zcta ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) five-digit Zonal Improvement Plan (ZIP) Code service routes that the Census Bureau creates using whole blocks to present statistical data from censuses and surveys. The Census Bureau defines ZCTAs by allocating each block that contains addresses to a single ZCTA, usually to the ZCTA that reflects the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses within that tabulation block. Blocks that do not contain addresses, but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA; those surrounded by multiple ZCTAs are added to a single ZCTA based on limited buffering performed between multiple ZCTAs. The Census Bureau identifies five-digit ZCTAs using a five-character numeric code that represents the most frequently occurring USPS ZIP Code within that ZCTA, and this code has a fixed length of five digits and may contain leading zeros. Not all ZIP Codes in use by the USPS may have a ZCTA delineated to represent them, The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery. In addition, the ZCTA delineation process primarily uses residential addresses and has a bias towards ZIP Codes used for city-style mail delivery, thus there may be ZIP Codes that are primarily nonresidential or used for PO boxes only that may not have a corresponding ZCTA. ZIP Code is a trademark of the U.S. Postal Service. 2.3.5 Legislative Distrcts tidycensus term = congressional district tidycensus term = state legislative district (upper chamber) (senate) tidycensus term = state legislative district (lower chamber) (house) Congressional Districts are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states based on decennial census population counts, each state with multiple seats is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives. Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable. For the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each Island Area, a separate code is used to identify the entire areas of these state-equivalent entities as having a single nonvoting delegate. State Legislative Districts (SLDs) are the areas from which members are elected to state legislatures. The Census Bureau first reported data for SLDs as part of the 2000 Public Law 94-171 Redistricting Data File. Sources Census Bureau History of Census Tracts and Blocks Census Bureau Geographic Glossary Census Bureau Hierarchies Census Bureau GEOIDS "],["comparing-geographies-across-time.html", "3 Comparing Geographies Across Time 3.1 Converting Vintages 3.2 Comparing Within Vintage", " 3 Comparing Geographies Across Time Geographic boundaries change all the time. While large geographies like states are unlikely to change, places and even counties can change through annexation and secession that shift area between existing units or create new ones. Census geographies (i.e., blocks and tracts) generally remain stable between Decennial Censuses, but are always revised with each new Census through border adjustments and the creation of new units from fast growing areas. This means comparing indicators over time, especially across decades (e.g., pre-pandemic 2019 to anything post-pandemic in the 2020s), requires first ensuring the geography being compared is consistent. 3.1 Converting Vintages The easiest way to ensure comparability is to use a crosswalk that converts the data into a common vintage of blocks and tracts (e.g., converting 2010 tracts to 2020 tracts to compare pre- and post-pandemic indicators). For example: What this shows is that all of tract 36047000301 in 2000 is within tract 36047000301 in 2010, while tract 36047000302 in 2000 was split into tracts 36047000100 and 36047004700 in 2010. Specifically, 83.8% of tract 36047000302 ended up in tract 36047000100 while the remaining 16.2% ended up in tract 36047004700. To convert data aggregated by 2000 tracts into data aggregated by 2010 tracts do the following: sample_data First, join the crosswalk by the 2000 tract ID: sample_data %&gt;% dplyr::inner_join( crosswalk_ct00_ct10, by = &quot;Tract 2000&quot; ) Then, multiply the indicator by the appropriate weight: sample_data %&gt;% dplyr::inner_join( crosswalk_ct00_ct10, by = &quot;Tract 2000&quot; ) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate( Population_wt = Population * Weight ) Finally, group by the 2010 tract ID and sum the weighted indicator: sample_data %&gt;% dplyr::inner_join( crosswalk_ct00_ct10, by = &quot;Tract 2000&quot; ) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate( Population_wt = Population * Weight ) %&gt;% dplyr::summarize( .by = `Tract 2010`, Population = sum(Population_wt, na.rm = TRUE) ) A note of caution: this is an estimate! This process assumes people are distributed equally across the source geography such that, if X% of the source geography is located in the target geography, X% of the population (including X% of each age, race, etc.) is also within the target geography. If the population is concentrated or if different segments of the population are segregated, this conversion process will be inaccurate. Additionally, this process is only appropriate for counts and sums and not for medians or other quantiles. For rates or percentages, convert the numerator and denominator separately, then recompute the rate in the target geography. 3.1.1 IPUMS NHGIS The most straightforward source for geographic crosswalks is IPUMS NHGIS. While the crosswalks only go back to the 1990 Census, IPUMS allows you to go from many geographies to many other geographies across many supported census years: Source Geography Target Geography Source Year Target Year Census Tracts Census Tracts 1990 2010 Census Tracts Census Tracts 2000 2010 Census Tracts Census Tracts 2010 2020 Census Tracts Census Tracts 2020 2010 Block Groups Block Groups, Census Tracts 2010 2020 Block Groups Block Groups, Census Tracts 2020 2010 Census Blocks Census Blocks, Block Groups, Census Tracts 1990 2010 Census Blocks Census Blocks, Block Groups, Census Tracts 2000 2010 Census Blocks Census Blocks, Block Groups, Census Tracts 2010 2020 Census Blocks Census Blocks, Block Groups, Census Tracts 2020 2010 The crosswalk file name indicates which geographic levels, years, and geographic extent are covered in the file: nhgis_[source level][source year]_[target level][target year]{_state FIPS code}.csv (e.g., nhgis_tr2020_tr2010_36.csv converts 2020 Census tracts to 2010 Census tracts for New York, state code 36). Each file provides a different weight based on the universe of the indicator: Weight Description Example Indicator wt_pop Expected proportion of source zones total population located in target zone Table B03002: Hispanic or Latino Origin by Race wt_hh Expected proportion of source zones households (aka occupied housing units) located in target zone Table B25003: Tenure wt_hu Expected proportion of source zones housing units (occupied and vacant) located in target zone Table B25136: Structure Type by Occupancy Status wt_ownhu Expected proportion of source zones owner-occupied housing units located in target zone Table B25081: Mortgage Status wt_renthu Expected proportion of source zones renter-occupied housing units located in target zone Table B25070: Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income 3.1.2 Brown University LTDB If you need to look further back in time and are only interested in Census tracts, the Longitudinal Tract Data Base at Brown University provides a crosswalk for comparing tracts from 1970-2020. These crosswalks are less detailed as they only convert Census tract geographies to the 2010 boundaries and only provide one weight. 3.2 Comparing Within Vintage Once data is aggregated to the same vintage, it is generally possible to directly compare the values. The one caveat is comparing ACS data: in general, 1-year ACS and 5-year ACS should only be compared to the same survey and 5-year ACS cannot compare overlapping years (e.g., the 5-year 2019 data cannot be compared with the 5-year 2016 data because both are pooling data from 2015 and 2016). "],["querying-decennial-and-acs-data-with-tidycensus.html", "4 Querying Decennial and ACS Data with tidycensus 4.1 API Key 4.2 Setting the Universe 4.3 Variables 4.4 Querying", " 4 Querying Decennial and ACS Data with tidycensus library(tidyverse) library(tidycensus) library(DT) Census data is available online at data.census.gov. This is an ok website to explore variables, but it is not easy to customize data downloads to get a variety of geographies or specific variables. Instead, tidycensus allows you to pull in most data from: Decennial Census (1990-present) American Community Survey 1-Year Data (2005-present) American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2009-present) For older Census data, use the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS). For microdata (e.g., to cut the data differently than is available in the standard tables) use IPUMS. 4.1 API Key An API key is a short authentication string issued by a data provider that accompanies requests so the service can recognize and regulate access. The tidycensus package can run without a key, but requests are subject to a limit of 500 queries per IP address per day. Obtaining a key is recommended for regular or large data pulls because it reduces the risk of throttling. A free, immediately-issued key can be obtained at api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. Note: this is your API key; save the email from the Census and avoid typing the key into saved code or otherwise sharing it. Instead, run the following code once by pasting it directly into the console: tidycensus::census_api_key(&quot;YOUR API KEY GOES HERE&quot;, overwrite = TRUE, install = TRUE) 4.2 Setting the Universe Before selecting variables, it is important to establish the universe being queried. The combined selection of geographic level, survey, and year determines which variables are available and how those variables are coded. 4.2.1 Geographic Level Chapter 2 provides a detailed description of geographic levels and how to they are called in the query. In general, the geographic level is selected based on a projects unit of analysis and overall analytical design. However, this choice directly affects data availability: some variables are not reported for smaller geographies, and working at finer geographic scales often requires certain surveys like the ACS 5-year estimates over the ACS 1-year estimates. Obtaining tract- or block-level data for later reaggregation is also an option, although median values are difficult to aggregate accurately. 4.2.2 Survey tidycensus has two main functions to query either the Decennial Census (get_decennial()) or the ACS (get_acs()). In addition to the Decennial Census being a true census while the ACS is a survey, the choice between the two often comes down to frequency of data collection (decennial vs annual) and indicators of interest (basic enumeration versus a wide range of socioeconomic indicators). Querying the ACS requires a survey argument of either acs1 or acs5. The 1-year survey (acs1) provides single year estimates for areas with populations of at least 65,000, while the 5-year survey (acs5) provides five year pooled estimates that cover all geographies down to the tract and block group level. (Pooling estimates increases statistical reliability by expanding the effective sample size, which reduces sampling error and improves estimate stability for small geographies and rare populations.) Projects typically use the 1-year survey for large geographies when timeliness is critical and the 5-year survey for smaller areas or when greater statistical reliability is needed. Querying the Decennial Census has a less intuitive survey argument called sumfile that has more to do with selecting a set of tables than selecting statistical strength: 2020 Decennial Survey Code Title Use Case PL P.L. 94-171 Redistricting File Basic population and housing counts including voting age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, housing occupancy, and major group quarters categories DHC Demographic and Housing Characteristics File Detailed demographic and housing characteristics including age and sex distributions, household and family structure, relationship to householder, tenure, and group quarters detail 2010 Decennial Survey Code Title Use Case SF1 Summary File 1 Basic population and housing characteristics including age, sex, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household type, family type, relationship to householder, group quarters population, housing occupancy, and housing tenure SF2 Summary File 2 Detailed race and Hispanic origin tabulations providing expanded race specific iterations of selected population and housing tables 2000 Decennial Survey Code Title Use Case SF1 Summary File 1 Basic population and housing characteristics including age, sex, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household type, family type, relationship to householder, group quarters population, housing occupancy, and housing tenure SF2 Summary File 2 Detailed race and Hispanic origin tabulations providing expanded race specific iterations of selected population and housing tables SF3 Summary File 3 Sample based socioeconomic characteristics including income, poverty, employment, education, commuting, housing costs, and detailed housing characteristics SF4 Summary File 4 Detailed race and Hispanic origin tabulations providing expanded race specific iterations of selected socioeconomic tables from Summary File 3 1990 Decennial Survey Code Title Use Case STF1 Summary Tape File 1 Basic population and housing characteristics including age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, household type, family type, relationship to householder, group quarters population, housing occupancy, and housing tenure STF2 Summary Tape File 2 Detailed race and Hispanic origin tabulations providing expanded race specific iterations of selected population and housing tables STF3 Summary Tape File 3 Sample based socioeconomic characteristics including income, poverty, employment, education, commuting, housing costs, and detailed housing characteristics STF4 Summary Tape File 4 Detailed race and Hispanic origin tabulations providing expanded race specific iterations of selected socioeconomic tables from Summary Tape File 3 4.2.3 Year One of the most important implications of the year selected is the vintage of the geographic level: all years within a decade report data aggregated to the vintage of the previous Decennial Census (e.g., data from 2019 is provided at 2010 boundaries while data from 2020 is provided at 2020 boundaries). In the special case of the 5-year ACS, the vintage is based on the final year even if the pooled years are divided by a Decennial Census (e.g., the 5-year ACS for 2020 is provided at 2020 boundaries even though it is pooling 1-year ACS data for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020). (See Chapter 3 for guidance on comparing indicators across vintages.) In addition to this structural implication, variables can be re-named, re-defined, added, or subtracted between years. Using the same query for multiple years is risky as it will often return data that is quietly different from what was intended. Make sure to separately pull variable codes and rename them for each year. For example: Note that 3 bins have been added since 2005, the cap increased from $2,000 or more in 2005 to $3,500 or more in 2010, and No Cash Rent was coded B25063_024 in 2005 and B25063_027 in 2024. 4.3 Variables tidycensus provides a way to quickly load all variables in a given year and survey, but the output is hard to work with: tidycensus::load_variables( year = 2020, dataset = &quot;pl&quot; ) Understanding the logic behind table numbering is an easier way to locate specific variables. 4.3.1 ACS Tables ACS tables are labeled with codes like B01001A where each element provides information on the data contained within the table. When looking for a specific table or exploring a subject, the best place to start is the Census Reporter. 4.3.1.1 Type of Table E.g., B01001A is type B (a detailed base table) Code Title Definition B Detailed Base Table Most detailed estimates on all topics for all geographies C Detailed Collapsed Table Similar information from its corresponding Base Table (B) but at a lower level of detail because one or more lines in the Base Table have been grouped together K20 Supplemental Table Provides supplemental 1-year ACS estimates for selected geographies with populations between 20,000 and 65,000 S Subject Table A span of information on a particular ACS subject, such as veterans, presented in the format of both estimates and percentages R Ranking Table State rankings across approximately 90 key variables GCT Geographic Comparison Table Comparisons across approximately 95 key variables for geographies other than states such as counties or congressional districts DP Data Profile Broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information in a total of four profiles NP Narrative Profile Summaries of information in the Data Profiles using nontechnical text CP Comparison Profile Comparisons of ACS estimates over time in the same layout as the Data Profiles S0201 Selected Population Profile Broad ACS statistics for population subgroups by race, ethnicity, ancestry, tribal affiliation, and place of birth 4.3.1.2 Subject Only encoded in the table ID for B, C, K20, S, R, and GCT tables E.g., B01001A is subject 01 (age and sex) Code Subject 01 Age; Sex 02 Race 03 Hispanic or Latino Origin 04 Ancestry 05 Citizenship Status; Year of Entry; Foreign Born Place of Birth 06 Place of Birth 07 Migration/Residence 1 Year Ago 08 Commuting (Journey to Work); Place of Work 09 Relationship to Householder 10 Grandparents and Grandchildren Characteristics 11 Household Type; Family Type; Subfamilies 12 Marital Status; Marital History 13 Fertility 14 School Enrollment 15 Educational Attainment; Undergraduate Field of Degree 16 Language Spoken at Home 17 Poverty Status 18 Disability Status 19 Income 20 Earnings 21 Veteran Status; Period of Military Service 22 Food Stamps/Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 23 Employment Status; Work Status Last Year 24 Industry, Occupation, and Class of Worker 25 Housing Characteristics 26 Group Quarters 27 Health Insurance Coverage 28 Computer and Internet Use 29 Citizen Voting-Age Population 98 Quality Measures 99 Allocation Table for Any Subject 4.3.1.3 Table Number E.g., B01001A is table number 001 (sex by age) of subject 01 A 2-3 digit number that uniquely identifies the table within a given subject. 4.3.1.4 Race Iteration Selected tables only E.g., B01001A is the version of table B01001 that looks only at iteration A (individuals identified as white alone, without regard to Hispanic or Latino origin) Code Population A White Alone B Black or African American Alone C American Indian and Alaska Native Alone D Asian Alone E Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Alone F Some Other Race Alone G Two or More Races H White Alone, Not Hispanic or Latino I Hispanic or Latino Note: This structure only provides the ability to break out race and ethnicity (i.e., Hispanic or Latino) for Non-Hispanic White (iteration H) and Hispanic of Any Race (iteration I), all other iterations (A-G) include Hispanic and non-Hispanic totals (i.e., they are not mutually exclusive with the Hispanic of Any Race iteration). 4.3.1.5 Frequently Used Tables Code Description Use Case B01001 Sex by Age Total population, male population, female population, under 18, over 65 B03002 Hispanic or Latino by Race Non-Hispanic race counts to avoid double counting when Hispanic is a category B19013 Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months Income estimate B19001 Household Income in the Past 12 Months Binned income counts B17001 Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months by Sex by Age Poverty count by age, sex, or both B23025 Employment Status for the Population 16 Years and Over Unemployment rate B25002 Occupancy Status Count of vacant, occupied, and total housing units B25003 Tenure Count of owner-occupied and renter-occupied units B25064 Median Gross Rent Rent estimate B25063 Gross Rent Binned rent counts B25071 Median Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income in the Past 12 Months Rent burden estimate B25070 Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income in the Past 12 Months Binned count of rent burden 4.3.2 Decennial Tables Decennial tables are less intuitive and require more exploration to identify the correct table. Each summary file (see above for more information) has a distinct set of tables, so the first step is selecting the summary file and then exploring the tables within that file. In general, tables are numbered as follows: Code Description P Population tables providing full detailed distributions of population characteristics H Housing tables providing full detailed distributions of housing unit characteristics PCT Population cross tabulations providing multi dimensional breakdowns of population characteristics across multiple variables HCT Housing cross tabulations providing multi dimensional breakdowns of housing characteristics across multiple variables PCO Population characteristics tables providing condensed summary indicators for selected population measures HCO Housing characteristics tables providing condensed summary indicators for selected housing measures PL Tables derived from the Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File 4.3.2.1 Frequently Used Tables Make sure to confirm the numbering is the same in the selected summary file Code Description Use Case P12 Sex by Age Total population, male population, female population, under 18, over 65 P5 Hispanic or Latino by Race Non-Hispanic race counts to avoid double counting when Hispanic is a category H3 Occupancy Status Count of vacant, occupied, and total housing units H4 Tenure Count of owner-occupied and renter-occupied units 4.4 Querying After deciding on the universe and identifying the variables of interest, plug everything into one of the tidycensus query functions. ### Basic Query # Decennial tidycensus::get_decennial( #Geographic Level geography = &quot;region&quot;, #Survey sumfile = &quot;sf1&quot;, #Year year = 2010, #Variables variables = c(Population = &quot;P001001&quot;) ) # American Community Survey tidycensus::get_acs( #Geographic Level geography = &quot;region&quot;, #Survey sumfile = &quot;acs1&quot;, #Year year = 2010, #Variables variables = c(Population = &quot;B01001_001&quot;) ) 4.4.1 Whole Table Query Note that the variables are only provided by code and not a descriptive label # American Community Survey tidycensus::get_acs( #Geographic Level geography = &quot;region&quot;, #Survey sumfile = &quot;acs1&quot;, #Year year = 2010, #Table table = &quot;B01001&quot; ) 4.4.2 Pre-Filtering Rather than pulling in all units of the geographic level selected, it is possible to limit the query to specific areas. Some small geographies (e.g., tracts and blocks) actually require specification of state and even county to avoid overwhelming the API. However, it is possible to include multiple specifications for each level within the same query. tidycensus::get_acs( geography = &quot;county&quot;, sumfile = &quot;acs1&quot;, year = 2010, state = &quot;36&quot;, #NY&#39;s FIPS code county = c( &quot;005&quot;, #Bronx &quot;047&quot;, #Kings/Brooklyn &quot;061&quot;, #New York/Manhattan &quot;081&quot;, #Queens &quot;085&quot; #Richmond/Staten Island ), variables = c(Population = &quot;B01001_001&quot;) ) 4.4.3 Iterating Each query must be for a single year and geographic level. To compare multiple levels and/or multiple years, use purrr to iterate. 4.4.3.1 Multiple Levels purrr::map_dfr( c(&quot;us&quot;, &quot;state&quot;), function(x) { get_acs( geography = x, survey = &quot;acs1&quot;, year = 2024, variables = c(Population = &quot;B01001_001&quot;) ) } ) 4.4.3.2 Multiple Years purrr::map_dfr( 2010:2019, function(x) { get_acs( geography = &quot;state&quot;, survey = &quot;acs1&quot;, year = x, state = &quot;36&quot;, variables = c(Population = &quot;B01001_001&quot;) ) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(year = x) } ) 4.4.4 Output Options As a package adjacent to the tidyverse, tidycensus defaults to a tidy output. This means that each row is a single variable for a single unit of the geographic level selected, with one column for the estimate and another for the margin of error (when querying the ACS). While this output works for many use cases, the presence of both the estimate and the margin of error makes it difficult to pivot wider while preserving both values. Instead, the output can be set to wide and then each row is a single unit of the geographic level selected and each variable as two columns, one for the estimate (E) and another for the margin of error (M) tidycensus::get_acs( #Geographic Level geography = &quot;region&quot;, #Survey sumfile = &quot;acs1&quot;, #Year year = 2010, #Variables variables = c( Male_pop = &quot;B01001_002&quot;, Female_pop = &quot;B01001_026&quot; ) ) tidycensus::get_acs( #Geographic Level geography = &quot;region&quot;, #Survey sumfile = &quot;acs1&quot;, #Year year = 2010, #Variables variables = c( Male_pop = &quot;B01001_002&quot;, Female_pop = &quot;B01001_026&quot; ), output = &quot;wide&quot; ) "],["querying-nyc-hvs-data.html", "5 Querying NYC HVS Data 5.1 Survey Design 5.2 Variables 5.3 Examples", " 5 Querying NYC HVS Data library(tidyverse) library(srvyr) library(DT) #All HVS PUF Datasets all23 &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/data/allunits_puf_23.csv&quot;) occ23 &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/data/occupied_puf_23.csv&quot;) vac23 &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/data/vacant_puf_23.csv&quot;) per23 &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/data/person_puf_23.csv&quot;) The NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey (HVS) is a comprehensive housing survey conducted approximately every three years by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). Established in 1965, the HVS was created in response to the Citys Rent Stabilization Law, which requires periodic measurement of the citywide rental vacancy rate to determine whether a housing emergency exists. Beyond its legal function, the survey serves as the citys primary source of detailed data on housing conditions, affordability, and demographics. It collects information on occupancy status, rent, utilities, income, building age, and physical quality, among many other variables. The HVS provides a unique longitudinal record of New Yorks housing stock and is considered one of the most detailed local housing datasets in the United States. In the wake of Donald Trumps election and subsequent efforts to restrict access to federal data, the administration removed or suppressed numerous websites and datasets from agencies such as the Census Bureau. In response, responsibility for hosting and maintaining public access shifted into the hands of NYCs HPD, ensuring continued public access and stewardship of this vital housing data tool. As such, all information about the survey, as well as the survey data itself, is located here: https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/about/research.page There are four public use files that provide microdata to work with: The CONTROL variable joins all of the tables together, with every housing unit in the All Units dataset being in either Occupied Units or Vacant Units, and every person living in an Occupied Unit showing up as their own row in the Persons dataset (i.e., many-to-one match). Projects should start by identifying the universe of interest (all, occupied, or vacant units) and then left join to that dataset (using CONTROL as the key) to pull in variables from other datasets. 5.1 Survey Design Unlike the American Community Survey (ACS), which provides thousands of pre-calculated indicators in ready-made tables and crosstabs, the HVS is released primarily as raw microdata. Each record represents an individual housing unit or person, requiring users to construct their own measures and apply statistical weights to produce representative estimates. Working with the HVS therefore involves a more hands-on analytical process: users must merge datasets, define variables, and apply survey design adjustments using software capable of complex survey processing, such as Rs srvyr package. This structure makes the HVS both more flexible and more demanding, allowing researchers to generate customized analyses while maintaining methodological rigor. The optimal workflow is (1) decide on a universe of housing units, (2) pull together needed variables from the different files, and (3) convert the dataframe to a replicate-weighted survey design object (using pre-set arguments outlined in the HVS documentation): occ23 %&gt;% dplyr::left_join( all23 %&gt;% dplyr::select(CONTROL, CSR), by = &quot;CONTROL&quot;) %&gt;% srvyr::as_survey_rep( weights = FW, repweights = num_range(&quot;FW&quot;, 1:80), type = &quot;other&quot;, combined_weights = TRUE, scale = 4/80, rscales = 1, mse = TRUE ) ## Call: Called via srvyr ## with 80 replicates and MSE variances. ## Sampling variables: ## -

This structure enables design-based analysis, allowing estimates, variances, and confidence intervals to reflect the HVSs sampling methodology. With this object in place, researchers can use tidyverse-style verbs such as summarize() with functions from srvyr like: survey_total() for counts survey_total(col) for sums survey_mean(col) for means survey_median(col) for medians survey_quantile(col, quantiles = x) for other quantiles Etc. occ23 %&gt;% srvyr::as_survey_rep( weights = FW, repweights = num_range(&quot;FW&quot;, 1:80), type = &quot;other&quot;, combined_weights = TRUE, scale = 4/80, rscales = 1, mse = TRUE ) %&gt;% dplyr::summarize( .by = TENURE, count = srvyr::survey_total(), median_hhsize = srvyr::survey_median(HHSIZE) ) %&gt;% DT::datatable() %&gt;% DT::formatRound(c(&quot;count&quot;, &quot;median_hhsize&quot;), digits = 0) %&gt;% DT::formatRound(c(&quot;count_se&quot;, &quot;median_hhsize_se&quot;), digits = 1) 5.2 Variables The HVS Codebook is the central reference for identifying, locating, and interpreting variables in the survey. It lists every variable and indicates which of the four datasets it is stored in, making it the first place to look when selecting variables or joining data across files. Because all responses are stored as numeric codes rather than text, the Codebook is also necessary for translating these values into their intended meanings and for avoiding common misreadings that can distort results. Commonly used variables include the following: 5.2.1 Borough (All Units) all23 %&gt;% dplyr::mutate( boro = dplyr::case_when( BORO == 1 ~ &quot;Bronx&quot;, BORO == 2 ~ &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, BORO == 3 ~ &quot;Manhattan&quot;, BORO == 4 ~ &quot;Queens&quot;, BORO == 5 ~ &quot;Staten Island&quot;

Whereas the published tables of the American Community Survey (ACS) provide pre-calculated indicators and aggregated statistics for predefined geographies, IPUMS offers anonymized versions of the underlying person- and household-level records. Access to these raw microdata enables finer-grained analysis and the ability to create cross-tabulations of variables that are not combined in standard ACS products. Example The ACS surveys renter-occupied households about their rent. Whereas Table B25064 provides the median rent for a given geography, Table B25063 provides a distribution of rent amounts. However, the bins are pre-set with bin widths of $50 for rents under $800, $100 for rents under $1,000, $250 for rents under $1,500, $500 for rents under $3,500, and then a ceiling of $3,500. With a citywide median of around $1,700, these bin widths are not ideal for analyzing NYC rents. library(tidycensus) acs_rent &lt;- tidycensus::get_acs( geography = &quot;place&quot;, state = &quot;36&quot;, table = &quot;B25063&quot;, year = 2023, survey = &quot;acs1&quot; ) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(NAME == &quot;New York city, New York&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::transmute( rent = dplyr::case_when( variable == &quot;B25063_001&quot; ~ &quot;DROP&quot;, #Total variable == &quot;B25063_002&quot; ~ &quot;DROP&quot;, #With cash rent variable == &quot;B25063_003&quot; ~ &quot;0-99&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_004&quot; ~ &quot;100-149&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_005&quot; ~ &quot;150-199&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_006&quot; ~ &quot;200-249&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_007&quot; ~ &quot;250-299&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_008&quot; ~ &quot;300-349&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_009&quot; ~ &quot;350-399&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_010&quot; ~ &quot;400-449&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_011&quot; ~ &quot;450-499&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_012&quot; ~ &quot;500-549&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_013&quot; ~ &quot;550-599&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_014&quot; ~ &quot;600-649&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_015&quot; ~ &quot;650-699&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_016&quot; ~ &quot;700-749&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_017&quot; ~ &quot;750-799&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_018&quot; ~ &quot;800-899&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_019&quot; ~ &quot;900-999&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_020&quot; ~ &quot;1000-1249&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_021&quot; ~ &quot;1250-1499&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_022&quot; ~ &quot;1500-1999&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_023&quot; ~ &quot;2000-2499&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_024&quot; ~ &quot;2500-2999&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_025&quot; ~ &quot;3000-3499&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_026&quot; ~ &quot;3500-Inf&quot;, variable == &quot;B25063_027&quot; ~ &quot;DROP&quot; #No cash rent ), Estimate = estimate, MOE = stringr::str_c( &quot;+/- &quot;, scales::comma(moe, accuracy = 1) ) ) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(rent != &quot;DROP&quot;) %&gt;% tidyr::separate( rent, into = c(&quot;Bin_Min&quot;, &quot;Bin_Max&quot;), sep = &quot;-&quot; ) acs_rent %&gt;% DT::datatable() %&gt;% DT::formatCurrency(c(&quot;Bin_Min&quot;, &quot;Bin_Max&quot;), currency = &quot;$&quot;, digits = 0) %&gt;% DT::formatRound(c(&quot;Estimate&quot;), digits = 0) IPUMS provides the underlying microdata with the actual rent of each household, allowing this table to be re-binned. ipums_rent &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;./Data/nyc_micro_rent.csv&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::transmute( household = SERIAL, HHWT, rent = dplyr::case_when( RENTGRS &lt; 500 ~ &quot;0-499&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 1000 ~ &quot;500-999&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 1500 ~ &quot;1000-1499&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 2000 ~ &quot;1500-1999&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 2500 ~ &quot;2000-2499&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 3000 ~ &quot;2500-2999&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 3500 ~ &quot;3000-3499&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 4000 ~ &quot;3500-3999&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 4500 ~ &quot;4000-4499&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 5000 ~ &quot;4500-4999&quot;, RENTGRS &gt;= 5000 ~ &quot;5000-Inf&quot; ) ) %&gt;% dplyr::distinct(household, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% srvyr::as_survey(weights = HHWT) %&gt;% dplyr::summarize( .by = rent, Estimate = srvyr::survey_total() ) %&gt;% dplyr::transmute( rent, Estimate, MOE = stringr::str_c( &quot;+/- &quot;, scales::comma(Estimate_se, accuracy = 1) ) ) %&gt;% tidyr::separate( rent, into = c(&quot;Bin_Min&quot;, &quot;Bin_Max&quot;), sep = &quot;-&quot; ) ipums_rent %&gt;% dplyr::arrange(as.double(Bin_Min)) %&gt;% DT::datatable() %&gt;% DT::formatCurrency(c(&quot;Bin_Min&quot;, &quot;Bin_Max&quot;), currency = &quot;$&quot;, digits = 0) %&gt;% DT::formatRound(c(&quot;Estimate&quot;), digits = 0) 6.1 Extracting Data IPUMS data is available online at https://usa.ipums.org/usa/.

Selecting geographic fields does not impact which records are sampled (a filter is required for that), it just provides a code in each record to aggregate the data to that level. 6.1.3 Select Variables IPUMS tries to harmonize variables across datasets, but make sure the variable(s) selected match the use-case and are available for all years. The metadata also provides info on top coding and other categorizations. 6.1.4 View Data Cart Ensure everything is correct, and then click Create Data Extract. 6.1.5 Modify Extract From this page you can: Change the file output to CSV Select cases (i.e. filter the sample) by state Adjust monetary values to 2010 6.1.6 Download Once the extract is completed, download the CSV. The download will likely show up as a .csv.gz file, so use 7-Zip to extract the zipped file instead of the default Windows option (Windows Explorer sometimes misinterprets .gz files and produces thousands of fragments).

However, unlike the NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey which has dozens of replicate weights to account for, IPUMS is much easier to work with. All that is needed is to create a survey object with the weight specified as either the household or person weight. IPUMS data is always provided at the person-level where each row represents a person. This is true even if all of the variables selected are household-level variables (in which case the household-level variables are repeated across all individuals in the household). When using person-level variables, use all records and the PERWT weight; when using household-level variables, first select only one row per household/SERIAL and then use the HHWT weight. #Household-level data ipums_hh_data %&gt;% #Select one row per household dplyr::distinct(SERIAL, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% srvyr::as_survey(weights = HHWT) #Person-level data ipums_ind_data %&gt;% srvyr::as_survey(weights = PERWT) #Mixed data ipums_mix_data %&gt;% #Select specific row per household, in this case Head of Household dplyr::filter(RELATE == 1) %&gt;% srvyr::as_survey(weights = HHWT) Once the survey object is created, srvyr has a series of functions that calculate estimates with margins of error. survey_total() for counts survey_total(col) for sums survey_mean(col) for means survey_median(col) for medians survey_quantile(col, quantiles = x) for other quantiles Etc. readr::read_csv(&quot;./Data/nyc_micro_rent.csv&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::distinct(SERIAL, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% srvyr::as_survey(weights = HHWT) %&gt;% dplyr::summarize( median_rent = srvyr::survey_median(RENTGRS, na.rm = TRUE), mean_rent = srvyr::survey_mean(RENTGRS, na.rm = TRUE) ) %&gt;% DT::datatable() %&gt;% DT::formatCurrency(c(&quot;median_rent&quot;, &quot;median_rent_se&quot;, &quot;mean_rent&quot;, &quot;mean_rent_se&quot;), currency = &quot;$&quot;, digits = 2) When grouping, summarize() fails with multiple .by arguments, so multiple grouping variables should be concatenated before summarizing. readr::read_csv(&quot;./Data/nyc_micro_rent.csv&quot;) %&gt;% #Create new variables dplyr::transmute( household = SERIAL, HHWT, borough = dplyr::case_when( COUNTYFIP == 5 ~ &quot;Bronx&quot;, COUNTYFIP == 47 ~ &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, COUNTYFIP == 61 ~ &quot;Manhattan&quot;, COUNTYFIP == 81 ~ &quot;Queens&quot;, COUNTYFIP == 85 ~ &quot;Staten_Island&quot; ), rent = dplyr::case_when( .default = &quot;Normal&quot;, RENTGRS &lt; 500 ~ &quot;Very Low&quot;, RENTGRS &gt; 4000 ~ &quot;Very High&quot; ), RENTGRS ) %&gt;% #Concatenate variables into one column dplyr::transmute( household, HHWT, group = stringr::str_c(borough, rent, sep = &quot;-&quot;), RENTGRS ) %&gt;% dplyr::distinct(household, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% srvyr::as_survey(weights = HHWT) %&gt;% #Group and analyze by the concatenated variable dplyr::summarize( .by = group, rent = srvyr::survey_median(RENTGRS, na.rm = TRUE) ) %&gt;% #Split the concatenated variable back into multiple variables tidyr::separate( group, into = c(&quot;borough&quot;, &quot;rent_level&quot;), sep = &quot;-&quot; ) %&gt;% dplyr::select(-rent_se) %&gt;% tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = borough, values_from = rent) %&gt;% DT::datatable() %&gt;% DT::formatCurrency(c(&quot;Bronx&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Queens&quot;, &quot;Staten_Island&quot;), digits = 0) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
